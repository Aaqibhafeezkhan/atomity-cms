# Atomity CMS

Open-source CMS for the content that sits next to the product: **news**, **career openings**,
**documentation** and **knowledge-base** articles.

An editor picks a content type, fills in guided fields, saves a draft, validates it and clicks
Publish. Published content is then available through a public, read-only API, so separate websites
can fetch and render it. **The CMS never controls how those websites look.**

> **Status: initial skeleton.** It works end to end locally (create, validate, publish, read through
> the public API, show on an example website) and is meant to be extended by contributors.
> It is not production-ready, and nothing in this repository talks to any Atomity production system.

- **Frontend**: Next.js 16 (App Router), React 19, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS v4, Tiptap
- **Backend**: Spring Boot 3.4, Java 21, Gradle
- **Database**: PostgreSQL 16, schema managed by Flyway
- **Media**: images on the local filesystem (a Docker volume), no external storage needed

It is built on the same foundation as Atomity's Blog CMS (same stack, layout and conventions), with
one shared content model instead of a blog-only one.

## What it does and does not do

| It does | It does not |
|---|---|
| Four content types with their own guided fields and validation | Render, host or deploy any website |
| Draft → published → archived lifecycle, with validation on publish | Push content anywhere: no webhooks, no builds, no cache revalidation |
| A public read API that only ever returns published content | Manage several users or roles (one admin account) |
| Rich text (Tiptap JSON) and local image uploads | Schedule posts, keep revisions, or translate content |
| An example website (`examples/mock-consumer`) that consumes the API | Decide where a type is shown: the "destination" is only descriptive metadata |

## Content types

| Key | Purpose | Extra fields (**bold** = required to publish) |
|---|---|---|
| `news` | Announcements and updates | none |
| `career` | Job openings and internships | **department**, **location**, **employmentType** (`full-time`, `part-time`, `intern`, `contract`), **applyUrl**, closingDate, remote |
| `docs` | Guides and onboarding documentation | **section**, order |
| `kb` | Troubleshooting and knowledge-base articles | **symptom**, product, affectedVersions |

Every item also has a title, slug, excerpt, rich-text body, status and timestamps. A draft can be
saved with anything missing; **publishing** needs a title, some content and the type's required
fields. Slugs are unique within a type. The set of types lives in one Java class,
[`ContentTypes`](backend/src/main/java/io/atomity/generalcms/content/ContentTypes.java); see
[Adding a content type](docs/adding-a-content-type.md).

## Admin UI

Sign in, then **Content**: a list you can filter by type and status and search, and **New content**, which asks for a
type first. The editor has a title, slug, excerpt, the Tiptap rich-text editor with images from the media library,
and a details panel generated from the type's fields (text, URL, date, number, yes/no and select inputs; required
ones are marked). **Save draft** keeps anything incomplete; **Publish** explains what is missing instead of failing
silently; published items offer **Update** and **Unpublish**, and the "…" menu archives. Unsaved changes are
guarded, and a version conflict (someone else saved) is reported rather than overwritten. **Media** is the image
library.

## How publishing works

```text
 editor (admin UI)            backend                       website (any consumer)
 ─────────────────            ───────────────────────       ──────────────────────
 pick type, fill fields ─►    POST /api/v1/posts   (draft)
 Publish               ─►    POST /api/v1/posts/{id}/publish
                              validates → status PUBLISHED
                                                       ◄─    GET /api/v1/content/{type}
                                                       ◄─    GET /api/v1/content/{type}/slug/{slug}
```

"Publish" only changes the item's status in the database. The public API starts returning it; the
website pulls it when it wants to. Nothing is deployed or sent anywhere, and unpublishing or archiving
makes the next request return `404`.

### How a website consumes it

```bash
curl -s localhost:8080/api/v1/content-types                      # the types, their fields and destination hints
curl -s 'localhost:8080/api/v1/content/career?size=10'           # published careers, newest first
curl -s localhost:8080/api/v1/content/news/slug/my-first-post    # one item, including its body
```

The body is a Tiptap/ProseMirror JSON document; the consumer renders it however it likes.
`examples/mock-consumer` shows a small renderer. Fetch on the server: the backend has no CORS
configuration by design. See [docs/api.md](docs/api.md) for every endpoint and response shape.

## Quick start (Docker)

Requires Docker with Compose v2. No JDK, Node or PostgreSQL is needed, and no external accounts.

```bash
cp .env.example .env     # safe local defaults; nothing here points at Atomity infrastructure
make up                  # or: docker compose up --build
```

The first build downloads dependencies and takes a few minutes.

| Service  | URL                                        |
|----------|--------------------------------------------|
| Admin UI | http://localhost:3000                      |
| Backend  | http://localhost:8080/health/readiness     |
| Postgres | `localhost:5432` (credentials from `.env`) |

Sign in with **admin@example.com / admin** (the local default from `.env.example`).

Ports are the same defaults as Blog CMS. If that stack is running, stop it or change `POSTGRES_PORT`,
`BACKEND_PORT` and `FRONTEND_PORT` in `.env`.

### See the whole flow

With the stack running:

```bash
make demo
```

This starts the example website at **http://localhost:4000** and runs
[`seed.mjs`](examples/mock-consumer/seed.mjs), which creates a draft of each type, proves the draft
is not public, shows an incomplete career being refused, publishes everything, and reads it back
through the public API. It exits non-zero if any step misbehaves. Re-running it is safe.

### Logs, stopping, resetting

```bash
docker compose logs -f backend       # follow a service's logs (postgres, backend, frontend, mock-consumer)
make down                            # stop; the database and uploaded images are kept
```

> **Warning, destructive:** `docker compose down -v` also deletes the named volumes `postgres-data`
> (all content) and `media-data` (all uploaded images). Use it only when you want a clean slate.

## Tests

| Command | What it runs | Needs |
|---|---|---|
| `make docker-test` | Backend tests (JUnit 5 + Testcontainers with a real Postgres) in a container | Docker |
| `make docker-check` | Frontend lint, typecheck, Vitest and production build in a container | Docker |
| `make consumer-test` | Unit tests of the example website's renderer | Docker |
| `make test` / `make check` | The same checks with your own toolchain (`check` = backend tests + frontend lint, types, tests, build) | JDK 21, Node ≥ 20.9 with npm ≥ 11.16, Docker |

`make docker-test` mounts the Docker socket so Testcontainers can start Postgres; it is written for
Docker Desktop (macOS, Windows) and may need adjusting on Linux.

## Local development without containers for the apps

```bash
make db                                   # Postgres only, in Docker
make backend                              # Spring Boot on :8080 (profile: local, reads .env)
cp frontend/.env.example frontend/.env.local
make install && make frontend             # Next.js on :3000 (also enables the git hooks)
```

## Configuration

| Variable | App | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `SPRING_DATASOURCE_URL` / `_USERNAME` / `_PASSWORD` | backend | Database connection |
| `ADMIN_EMAIL` | backend | Email of the single admin account |
| `ADMIN_PASSWORD_HASH` | backend | bcrypt hash of the admin password |
| `JWT_SECRET` | backend | Session-token signing key, at least 32 characters |
| `JWT_TTL` | backend | Session length (default `8h`) |
| `MEDIA_STORAGE_DIR` | backend | Directory for uploaded images (default `./data/media`; `/data/media` in Docker, a named volume) |
| `SERVER_PORT` | backend | HTTP port (default `8080`) |
| `BACKEND_API_URL` | frontend | Backend base URL, used server-side only |
| `SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE` | frontend | `false` to allow sign-in over plain HTTP on a host other than localhost |
| `CMS_API_URL` | mock consumer | Where the example website reads content from |

The admin password is never configured in plain text. Generate a hash with:

```bash
docker run --rm httpd:2.4-alpine htpasswd -nbBC 10 "" 'your-password' | tr -d ':\n'
```

In `.env`, wrap the hash in single quotes: it contains `$`, which Compose would otherwise expand.

## Contributing

Start with [docs/architecture.md](docs/architecture.md) and [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md). Good
first pieces: a new content type, a new field type, better rendering in the example website, more
tests. Everything can be developed and tested locally with the commands above; contributing never
needs production access. See also our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md).
